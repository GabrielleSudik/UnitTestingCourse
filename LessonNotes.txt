This solution needed the NUnit extension added and two NUnit NuGet packages.

Make sure when you create the new project it's the same kind as the project being tested.
Here, Windows Classic Desktop -- Class Library

The Tests project needs a reference to the base project.


Naming conventions:
	ProjectUnderTest.Tests: Business.Tests
	ClassNameUnderTestTests: CustomerTests
	Methods being tested: (prof and my favorite):
		void UnitUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedOutcome()
		void SumTwoNumbers_3and4_Returns7()
		(there are other ways, especially for weird methods)

Test -- Windows -- Test Explorer
Run All (or Run subset) will build the solution first.
Rightclick -- Add to Playlist will create playlists
	Playlist can then be set to whatever playlist you want.
	Check out your playlists in Notepad or something.

You can breakpoint and debug tests. 
You can group them and toggle auto running of tests with menu at top of Test Explorer.

Assert.That is the heart of testing. Constraints are the heart of asserts:
	Major: is, has, does
	Next in importance: all, not, some (and others more rarely used)
	Ex: Assert.That(array, Is.All.Contains('b"));
		Assert.That(array, Has.All.GreaterThan(0));
		Assert.That(2+2, Is.Not.EqualTo(3));
		Assert.That(phrase, Does.Not.EndWith("!"));
		Assert.That(strings, Has.Some.StartsWith("gab"));
	Compound constraints:
		Assert.That(5, Is.LessThan(1).Or.GreaterThan(10));
		Assert.That(5, Is.LessThan(10).And.GreaterThan(1));)

Arrange -- Act -- Assert pattern. See CharacterTest for a layout.

Running tests from the console:
	First, you need a stand-alone download of NUnit at www.nunit.org
	The teacher really botched this part of the lesson.
	So you know it's possible, but you didn't try it.

Setup and Teardown: See the code for your notes.
You can also set high level setup and teardowns, that will run one time
before all of the other setups/tests/teardowns run.
